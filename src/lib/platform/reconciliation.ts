/**
 * PAY-09: the daily comparison of invoices, payments and the card provider's
 * settlements. Pure, so the server runs the same rules on the same records.
 *
 * - each invoice's paid amount equals its payments (chargebacks taken off),
 *   compared on today's records since an invoice holds its current balance;
 * - a payment for an invoice points to an invoice that exists;
 * - each day's card movements equal what the provider settled for that day;
 * - each finished refund has the money that left the bank.
 * Transfers waiting to be matched are counted, not reported as differences.
