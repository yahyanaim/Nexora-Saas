/**
 * Revenue recognition (Phase 6g.5). On a fixed-price project invoices don't
 * follow the work: a project billed 30% at kick-off may have earned almost
 * nothing yet. Revenue is earned as the work progresses:
 *  - hours: hours logged ÷ hours planned (phase budgets, else task estimates)
 *  - tasks: done tasks, weighted by their estimate
 *  - milestones: each milestone's share once it is reached
 * A closed project has earned its whole price. The price includes approved
 * change orders. The gap between earned and billed is work in progress
 * (earned, not billed) or billed in advance (billed, not earned).
